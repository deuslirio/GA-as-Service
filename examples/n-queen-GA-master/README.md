# N-Queen-GA
A JavaScript Genetic Algorithm implemented to solve the N-Queen Problem, which is a very popular combinatorial optimization problem.

**The N Queen** is the problem of placing N chess queens on an *NÃ—N* chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following Figure is a solution for 4 Queen problem. The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed

## GA's characteristics
 + Solution is represented as a permutation vector with *N* integers, where *N* is the number of queens to be placed;
 + Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX);
 + Swap mutation;
 + Parents selection based on a tournament between *k* individuals;
 + Merging populations based on total ranking;
 
## Parameters
The page presents some parameters through which one may notices their impact in the algorithm behavior. Such parameters and their default values are:  
 - *Population size:* **100** 
 - *Mutation rate:* **0.05**
 - *Crossover rate:* **0.80**
 - *Maximal of generations:* **200**
 - *K-tournament:* **3**
 - *N-Queens:* **8**
 - *Delay:* **100**
  
Despite implementation is able to find a solution for 200-Queens in 1,028 generation using 400 individuals, remember we are talking about a pure JavaScript toy running in your web browser. Be patient, it is regarding didactic material with no intention to be performatic.
